# Predicting NBA positions and creating new ones
*[Marcus Pahl]*


## Project Description
This project is split up in 3 steps. At first I'm predicting NBA positions based on stats of players. After that I'm creating new positions by clustering all players within the league. At last I use these clusters to determine the perfect team (distribution among clusters) and give teams a recommendation of what players they are missing in order to be a Top-Tier team.


## Hypotheses / Questions
* Can NBA positions be predicted?
* Which new NBA positions can be created?
* Which players are neede to be sucessful in the NBA?


## Dataset
* The datset was taken from basketball-reference.com. I chose the Season Dat for 2019/20 for modeling and the dataset for 18/19 for testing my model.


## Cleaning
In general I reduced the dataset to only players who have played mor than 9 Minutes per Game and played more than 10games through the entire season.


## Conclusion
* Players position can be predicted close to a 60% accuracy.
* The new found clusters can be used to further cluster the league since players are more versatile these day which is why the traditional positions don't apply anymore,


## Repository
data: all the data which has been used or has been saved in the process
